# The Peculiar Expedition

This is a text-based adventure game, inspired by (or rather copied from) [Curious Expedition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/358130/Curious_Expedition/).
The entire thing runs in a CLI and you control it by giving text commands.
I have made it as a school project aiming for practicing the OOP concept and Java.

## How to play the game?

1. Download the Jar file from here: [The Peculiar Expedition](jar/ThePeculiarExpedition.jar)
2. Open your CLI (like Command Prompt) and navigate to the folder where the downloaded file is located
3. Launch the game using the `java -jar ThePeculiarExpedition.jar` command

I hope you like it! ;)
